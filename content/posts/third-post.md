Verb tenses are the backbone of French communication, allowing you to express when actions occur. While French conjugation may seem daunting initially, breaking it down into logical groups makes it more approachable. This guide will walk you through the essential French tenses with clear examples and practical tips.

## Present Tense (Le Présent)

The present tense is your foundation for French verbs. It's used similarly to English to describe:
- Current actions: *Je mange une pomme.* (I'm eating an apple.)
- Habitual actions: *Nous allons au cinéma le vendredi.* (We go to the movies on Fridays.)
- Near future events: *Je pars demain.* (I'm leaving tomorrow.)

The conjugation patterns depend on the verb ending (-er, -ir, -re) and whether it's regular or irregular. Learning high-frequency irregular verbs like *être* (to be), *avoir* (to have), and *aller* (to go) should be your priority.

**Pro tip**: Create flashcards with the six conjugation forms (je, tu, il/elle, nous, vous, ils/elles) for each new verb you learn.

## Past Tenses

### Passé Composé

This is the most common past tense for completed actions. It's formed with an auxiliary verb (*avoir* or *être*) plus the past participle:

*J'ai mangé au restaurant hier.* (I ate at the restaurant yesterday.)
*Elle est arrivée à Paris.* (She arrived in Paris.)

Think of it as equivalent to the English simple past ("I ate") or present perfect ("I have eaten").

### Imparfait (Imperfect)

Use the imperfect tense for:
- Ongoing or habitual past actions: *Je jouais au tennis chaque semaine.* (I used to play tennis every week.)
- Setting the scene: *Il faisait beau ce jour-là.* (It was nice weather that day.)
- Describing feelings or states in the past: *J'étais heureux.* (I was happy.)

### Passé Composé vs. Imparfait

Understanding when to use each is crucial:
- Passé composé: Completed, specific actions with clear beginnings and ends
- Imparfait: Ongoing states, repeated habits, or background information

Consider this example:
*Je lisais un livre quand il est entré.* (I was reading a book when he entered.)
- *Je lisais* - ongoing action (imparfait)
- *il est entré* - specific, completed action (passé composé)

## Future Tenses

### Simple Future (Le Futur Simple)

Used for actions that will happen later:
*Nous irons en France l'année prochaine.* (We will go to France next year.)

The endings are the same for all verbs: -ai, -as, -a, -ons, -ez, -ont.

### Near Future (Le Futur Proche)

Formed with *aller* (conjugated in present) + infinitive:
*Je vais étudier ce soir.* (I'm going to study tonight.)

This is similar to "going to" in English and is used for actions happening in the near future.

## Conditional (Le Conditionnel)

Used for hypothetical situations or polite requests:
*J'aimerais un café, s'il vous plaît.* (I would like a coffee, please.)
*Si j'avais le temps, je voyagerais plus.* (If I had time, I would travel more.)

## Subjunctive (Le Subjonctif)

The subjunctive mood is used after certain expressions of emotion, doubt, or necessity:
*Il faut que tu finisses ton travail.* (It's necessary that you finish your work.)
*Je suis content que vous soyez ici.* (I'm happy that you are here.)

## Practice is Key

Understanding verb tenses requires regular, varied practice:

1. Use Parlo's conjugation exercises to master regular patterns
2. Write short paragraphs using different tenses
3. Listen for tense usage in French movies or podcasts
4. Practice speaking with tense-focused exercises

Remember that even native French speakers occasionally make errors with complex tenses. Focus on mastering one tense at a time, and prioritize those most common in everyday speech: present, passé composé, and futur proche.
